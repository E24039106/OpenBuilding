# OpenBuilding

We are a team from National Cheng Kung University, and we want to implement a website where people can design the interior of any building.
In our project, we refer [https://github.com/furnishup/blueprint3d](https://github.com/furnishup/blueprint3d) and make a platform for everyone to share their designs.
